# Predicting Austin Airbnb Prices

The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that would help me predict the best rental prices for Airbnb listings in Austin.

I downloaded the publicly available data directly from the Inside Airbnb website. You can access the data here: http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html

It covers all Austin listing details, calendar details, review details and associated geolocation information collected on September 19th, 2019. The data was published in the form of multiple csv files.
