# Springboard Capstone 1
A Github repository for my Capstone project 1.

The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that would help determine the most advantageous average nightly rental price for a given Airbnb listing in Austin.  

I downloaded the publicly available data directly from the Inside Airbnb website. You can access the data here: http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html

It covers all Austin listing details, calendar details, review details and associated geolocation information collected on September 19th, 2019. The data was published in the form of multiple csv files.
